My son was in Boy Scouts for a couple of years, and we went to a weekend camping trip at their Babcock Hovey Scout Camp. On our way to dig for fossils by the lake, I saw this piece of wood floating by the shore that had obviously been there for a while. There was faint blue paint, which had slowly eroded. I brought it back with us and made this guitar out of it. The top and back are made with this wood, and the sides are made from an old pallet that a neighbor had turned into a wine rack, but then discarded. I wanted the guitar to look old and worn out. The bridge is made from an old ruler, and a paintbrush without the handle or bristles
