My favorite skater growing up was Steve Caballero. His dragon skateboard stands out in my memory as my favorite. I had been toying with the idea of making a lapsteel out of a skateboard for some time, when I saw this Caballero model on Facebook marketplace for $20. When I went to pick it up I noticed it had a 6″ crack starting at the nose. “Perfect,” I thought, knowing that this skateboard was never to be ridden again. As I gave the guy the $20 I detected a sly smirk, like he thought he was tricking me out of my money. He had no idea what I was going to do with the skateboard…and I didn’t tell him.

This was my first time using an electric pickup and didn’t really know what I was doing. I embedded the pickup in the board, which resulted in it being too far away from the strings. I eventually removed the bolts to lower the action a bit.
