I went to Cuba in 2016 and brought back this cigar box with the intention of making a guitar out of it. This is the one that got me hooked on making instruments after making my first one in 2009. The neck came from a large picture frame that my neighbor was getting rid of. I made the fret board from a Home Depot yardstick, which took some time to sand away all the markings. The sound holes are drain covers, and the strings are attached to the box using a cabinet hinge.
