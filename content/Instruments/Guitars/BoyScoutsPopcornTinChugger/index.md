My son was in Boy Scouts for a few years. As you probably know, Boy Scouts sell popcorn to raise funds for their troop. Ours was no exception, so every year we went to Walmart and stood outside their doors selling popcorn. One year I decided to make a chugger (2 string guitar) out of one of the popcorn tins we were selling, then bring it with us to play while we sold popcorn. To make it stand out a bit, I woodburned the word “POPCORN!” on the neck. None of us know how to play guitar, so I think we ended up mostly annoying people as they walked by, giving us puzzled looks.
