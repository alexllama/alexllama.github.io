You might be driving down the road, see a pile of 2 by 4’s that someone put by the curb and think nothing of it. I think “I’ll make a Flying V guitar from those!” After removing all the nails and scraping away bits of insulation, I cut and glued these slats together into a rough Flying V shape. Since I don’t have a planer or a router, it is not super flat, and I smoothed out the edges with a belt sander. I had purchased a set with two humbuckers, tone and volume knobs and selector switch, ditched the pickguard that came with it and made one from 1/8″ plywood. The fret markers are just spray paint. I used the lower pitched strings from an Ernie Ball Mammoth Slinky pack to get a loooow sound. This is a guitar for playing Doom Metal exclusively.
