My son tried his hand at making a chugger…basically a two string guitar. I helped him along, but he did most of the work himself. We added springs on the inside to add a bit of reverb. He was very excited with the results, and I was super proud!

I highly recommend trying this project with your kids. It teaches them about handling tools, and the result is something they made and can be proud of. All you need is a box, a wooden dowel, and a couple of other random parts. A word of caution…this project takes more than a day to complete, so be prepared to encourage your child to complete it once they lose the initial interest.
