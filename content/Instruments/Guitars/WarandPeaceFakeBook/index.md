I got this box that looks like the book War and Peace and my first thought was to make a guitar out of it. At the time I was still pretty new to making instruments and you can tell, given how I made the neck. I thought I would try a different design for how to make the headstock. It was an interesting idea, but makes the neck so thick you can’t really play the first 2-3 frets. This is how we learn!

I made the bridge from a scrap piece of wood, and gave it its shape by using woodboring spade drill bits. Behind the bridge I added a piece of leather so that the strings wouldn’t cut into the box. It came from the tag on a purse’s zipper if I remember right. The fret markers are screws that I spray painted black. The neck is made from wood too…I hadn’t experimented with bone yet. All in due time…
