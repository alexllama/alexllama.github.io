Got this license plate from Playero, a surf shop in Puerto Rico (¡wepa boricua!) and made this license plate guitar. To keep the Puerto Rican theme going, I used dominos for the bridge and nut. I made the box from scratch using wood that came from a couch that had been put to the curb. I added a spring in the inside, which adds a bit of reverb. There’s a piezo (contact mic) under the license plate, so it can be played through an amp.
