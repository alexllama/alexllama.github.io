A friend of mine gave me this guitar, so I decided to experiment and make a resonator guitar with a couple of metal bowls, one inside the other. One of the tuners was broken, so this became a 5 string guitar. Just like Keith Richards plays! I had to add a bunch of reinforcements to the inside of the guitar so the pressure of the strings didn’t crush the bowl into the back of the guitar. For the bridge, I used the “puck” from a windchime. For the string holder, I used a drawer pull. When I was done I noticed the strings were not taut enough, so I added an aluminum bar to put more pressure on them. Doesn’t look great, but does the job.
