This is one of my favorites. It was my first attempt at making a guitar that looked “finished”, and is the first guitar I made with electric pickups. The box itself is beautiful. These Camacho boxes are popular for guitars because they have such a nice glossy finish. They are also very sturdy. I used a humbucker pickup, so the sound is clean. I added tone and volume pots, and matching silver hardware. This is one I go back to often when I want to noodle.
