I have loved the sound of the Hang Drum for quite some time. Having no interest in paying thousands of dollars for one, I thought about making an electronic version of one. My first attempt at it was years ago with an Arduino, but I ran into problems getting all the buttons to work. So I tucked the idea in a far corner of my brain. Recently I learned of a board called a [WAV Trigger](https://www.robertsonics.com/wav-trigger/), which essentially plays up to 16 sounds in WAV format, triggered by buttons. This was exactly what I needed! At that point my brain started thinking about how I could do it. We had this large bowl that my wife almost threw out. As soon as I saw it I knew it would be the perfect shape. I got some arcade buttons, a spare speaker from my collection of random speakers, a power supply harvested from an old sleep noise machine, and got to work on assembling it. To hold the lid with all the buttons in place I used two bourbon bottle stoppers and hair ties. I later added two additional stoppers (not pictured) since the top was moving around a lot. It was a bit more involved to get it done, but in the end I was very happy with the result. I got the Hang Drum samples from [Dark Arps](https://www.darkarps.com/hang-drum-multisampled-instrument/). There are 8 individual Hang Drum notes, plus a row of buttons at the bottom, which play background songs to play along with. On the top row there are Volume Up and Down buttons, and a red button which stops all the background tracks in case I want to pick a different one. And it has a headphone jack that shuts off the speaker when in use, in order not to annoy others around me.
