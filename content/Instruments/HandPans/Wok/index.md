I have wanted a Hang drum for a long time. However, they are quite expensive, so I keep looking for ways to make my own. I found a variation of this hand pan that uses tongues instead of the divots in the Hang drum, where people make them out of propane tanks. Not having a propane tank, nor the skills to cut and weld one of these tank drums, I instead opted to use an old steel wok. First I had to sand away the old faded paint, rust, and food particles accumulated over years of abuse. Then I cut the tongues with a jigsaw, not particularly tuning them to a specific scale. However, I like how it came out. You can play it with just your hands, or with rubber mallets. I made a couple by adding rubber bouncy balls to screwdrivers.
