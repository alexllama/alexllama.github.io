I made this one as a joke. Took a random scrap of wood, and added one of this small cans of Coca Cola as the resonator. Added a Ukulele tuner and a handful of frets, positioned by ear. It doesn’t sound very good, and the frets don’t really follow a scale. Although I like how I installed the tuner, with the string going through the neck so the tuner could be installed with the knob on the top of the neck.
