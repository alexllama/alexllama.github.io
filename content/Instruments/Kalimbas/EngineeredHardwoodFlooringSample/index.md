Lowes has these flooring samples that you can take with you to see how they might look in your house. Turns out you can also use them to make kalimbas. For this one I took two samples of engineered hardwood flooring and glued them back to back. I left the tongue and groove intact because I thought it looked interesting. I used wiper blades for the tines and a couple of grounding bars to hold them.
