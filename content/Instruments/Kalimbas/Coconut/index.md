During a trip to Costco I saw they sold these packs of ice cream, individually wrapped inside a half coconut. I immediately grabbed a pack with the full intention of making a kalimba out of the coconut. This was one of my first ones, experimenting with how to hold the tines down, using a piece of wood from a cutting board and a steel bracket with two screws.
