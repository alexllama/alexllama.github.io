Let’s face it, just about everything has been made out of Legos by now. I don’t think I have seen a kalimba though, until I made this one. I learned a hard lesson while making this one…it is a good idea to glue the pieces together as you build it. This is because the first time I made the box, while attempting to press a piece that was being particularly stubborn, the whole thing exploded and I had to start over!
