I made this kalimba as a gift for my sister. I took the wood from a tree that had fallen in our back yard. I carved the inside to make it hollow. The idea was to mimic a Sansula, which is a kalimba that is attached to a small drum to give it additional resonance. I drew the Taino symbol for the sun and added a coat of polyurethane to seal everything.
