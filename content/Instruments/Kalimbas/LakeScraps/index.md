In the Diddle Bows section of this site you’ll find a diddley bow I made from scraps I found on the shore while visiting a friend’s lakehouse. I also picked up enough materials to make a kalimba. Only the screws and tines did not come from the lake. In fact the tines are made from the metal bars that make the notes on a toy piano.
