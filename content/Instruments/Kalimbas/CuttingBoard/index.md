My wife was going to throw out this cutting board, so I immediately rescued it from the landfill and turned into a kalimba. I liked the small pyramids cut out on top. Almost like it challenges you to play it and not get hurt :)

I used wiper blades for the tines, and a long grounding bar to hold them in place. I colored some of the tines with a marker to try to have some way to tell them apart, but it came off after a while.
