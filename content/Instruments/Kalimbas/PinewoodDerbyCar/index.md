When my son was in Scouts they had a couple of pinewood derby races. After we made the car, I couldn’t resist and turned one of the wood scraps into a kalimba. The paint job is inspired by the classic blue and white Shelby Cobra. Needless to say, it does not meet the strict rules for racing…and it was not particularly fast. But the wheels vibrate, much like they put beer bottle caps on real kalimbas to make them rattle.
