This one took some time to build. I originally wanted to build a version of a hurdy gurdy. A neighbor had his backyard umbrella destroyed by a windstorm, and I salvaged the crank, immediately coming up with the idea to make a hurdy gurdy. Now, hurdy gurdys are elaborate instruments, and I was not about to take on that complicated of a build. So I thought I would make a similar instrument, but with three strings. Basically a cigar box guitar but with a handle to turn a wheel that would vibrate the strings.

My sister in law had brought me this old crate she found, which was falling apart. It was perfect for this project. I added corner reinforcements to the box, and added a center column made from a fence post to hold the neck. I attached two springs inside the box to add reverb. I then added a neck, fretboard, etc. and completed the instrument. I got some rosin from a friend of mine, applied it to the wheel and gave it a turn. It sounded terrible! I couldn’t get this thing to make a decent sound. It was the most horrible rumble, which was very discouraging. So I put the instrument in a corner of the basement and forgot about it.

Then one day about a year later I had a thought. What if I altered the wheel so that instead of rubbing the strings, it plucked them? I took out the wheel and cut it into a hexagon and nailed six guitar picks to it. I put it all back together, and changed the strings to four dulcimer strings. A quick turn of the handle produced a much better sound! It then occurred to me to take out three of the picks, so that when I turn the handle it strums in a pattern, which was more pleasing to hear.

Some time after I posted pictured to Facebook I had a guy offer me money to buy it from me. This was the first time anyone had wanted to buy one of my instruments, so I sold it to him. I have regretted it ever since. This is one of the more unique instruments I have made, and wish I had kept it for myself. Oh well, live and learn I guess…

By the way I also made a [Berimbau](/instruments/world/berimbau) with one of the arms from the umbrella.
