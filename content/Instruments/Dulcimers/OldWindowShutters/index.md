We got these old shutters from a neighbor with the intention of using them for decoration. However, they sat in the garage for a couple of years before we decided that wasn’t going to happen. So I quickly took a couple to make this dulcimer. I had an old plastic toy guitar I picked up at a thrift store, and ended up adding the piezo and volume control to the dulcimer so you can play it through an amp. The volume knob is the cap from a whiskey bottle. I added springs on the inside for reverb. The shutters are still functional, although they don’t affect the sound as I had hoped.
