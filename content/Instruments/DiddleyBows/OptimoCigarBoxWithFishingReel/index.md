This diddley bow has been through a couple of iterations. At first, it was a simple diddley bow I made in an afternoon. It featured a ukulele tuner, a piece of a door lock to hold the string, and a wooden plug for the bridge. I especially liked the writing on the box, which was apparently used to hold melon seeds. At some point I saw a video by the Blue Man Group where they had constructed an instrument that was played by rotating a wheel, which had plastic flaps all around its edge that would pluck the string, creating an endless strumming of the single string. I wanted to make this same sound, so I grabbed a fishing reel and attached a couple of zip ties to it. I also added some aluminum wire for frets. It is a bit clunky to play, but does the job.
