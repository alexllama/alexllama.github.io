Here are my first few attempts at a diddley bow. I changed it up a couple of times, but the concept stayed pretty consistent. I started with a scrap piece of wood that had been used as a property marker for snow plows to avoid tearing up my lawn (hence the blue paint on one end). I added a couple of screws to hold the string, and a couple of beer bottles to add tension. Since the wooden stake is so narrow, I had to add a separate board to keep it stable on a table.
