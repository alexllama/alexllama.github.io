Ok this one is pretty much a joke. We spotted a toy guitar at the dollar store and thought it would be funny to turn it into a playable instrument. I added a real tuner to attempt to get a real note out of it. The tension was so strong that I had to add a wooden dowel to the inside of the guitar to keep it from bending. It was a fun little experiment for an afternoon.
