I had a can of red wood stain, so I decided to make a diddley bow that looked like Eddie Van Halen’s classic Frankenstrat. The body is a scrap piece of wood that I had lying around. I got the paint job and black and red lines as close as I could to the original. I used a “Cap-O-Tone” from C.B. Gitty and an Altoids tin to add a piezo and volume knob so it can be played through an amp. The bridge is held to the frame by a cabinet hinge spray painted black. Later I added some frets from white wire hangers, and fret markers from thumbtacks
