A diddley bow is one of the simplest instruments you can make. All you need is a piece of wood, a string, two bridges to hold the string above the wood, and a tuner, if you want a specific note. This makes it a perfect project to make with your kids. And that’s exactly what we did here, when they were 5 and 7 years old. We used scrap wood for the body of the diddley bow. We got fancy and added an Altoids tin on one end with a piezo (contact mic) inside of it, so you can play it through an amplifier. I think the most fun part of the project was painting them. I let them pick the colors they wanted to use, and they did all the painting themselves. I purposely did not cover the sawhorses we used so they would get paint all over them, and to this day I remember this project whenever I look at them. To add a bit of a science lesson, we woodburned their names on the back using a magnifying glass (which came from my scanner camera – see elsewhere on this site for details on that one).
