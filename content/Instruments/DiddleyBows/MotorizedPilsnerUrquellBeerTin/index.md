After making a handcranked [Hurdy Gurdy Dulcimer mashup](/instruments/dulcimers/hurdygurdydulcimermashup), and a [Optimo Cigar Box Diddley Bow with Fishing Reel](/instruments/diddleybows/optimocigarboxwithfishingreel) to do the strumming, I thought…”why am I doing the cranking myself? I should automate this.” So I made this thing. I used a Pilsner Urquell beer lunchbox and added a small motor from an old toy. I glued a couple of wires to it, just long enough to hit the single string. To keep the beer theme going I used a bottle opener as the tailpiece. It sounds pretty terrible to be honest, watch the video and judge for yourself.
