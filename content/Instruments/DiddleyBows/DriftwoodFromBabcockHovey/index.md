My son was in Boy Scouts for a couple of years, and we went to a weekend camping trip at their Babcock Hovey Scout Camp in September, 2018. On our way to dig for fossils by the lake, I saw this piece of driftwood that looked perfect for a diddley bow. We pulled it out of the water, and found two rocks that would work perfectly as the bridge and nut. I added a thin humbucker pickup so it can be played via an amp. To commemorate the experience, I woodburned the date of the camping trip. This made for a great souvenir!
