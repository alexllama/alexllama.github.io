This build started with the unique yardstick I had. It was made from a square wooden dowel, with measurements on one edge and the name of the company on another edge. Given that it has some flex to it, I could only use it for a diddley bow, or risk it bending under string tension. The King Edward cigar box I used is a bit flimsy, so I reinforced it with wood. Looking back at these pictures I think I overdid it with the bracing, but you can never be too sure!

As is my preference, the hardware I used was mostly from items I had lying around. The nut is actually a eyehook that came from the 1890’s piano I found on the side of the road one day. As was the wood for the bridge. Adding a bit of fret wire completed the bridge. The string is held in place by a door lock, the kind you would use on a screen door to keep the wind from blowing it open. For the sound hole I used window screen mesh. Carving a notch in the neck allowed the Ukulele tuner to fit well.
