This one took part of an afternoon to complete. It was a simple build, just a box and a wooden dowel, a tuner and a bold for a bridge.

After seeing [this post](https://www.cigarboxguitars.com/post/1921-marxolin-one-string-slide-guitar) about a one string instrument called a Marxolin, I added a hose splicer to this diddley bow to try it out.
