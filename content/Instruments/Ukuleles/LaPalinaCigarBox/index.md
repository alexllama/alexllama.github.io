I made this Uke as a gift for a good friend of ours. Her husband had given me a bunch of cigar boxes when he learned I liked to make instruments. As a thank you, I made them this Ukulele. She actually knows how to play the Ukulele so I was happy to make this one to add to her collection. The neck is made from a water ski that somebody threw away. I used a door strike plate to hold the strings, and the emergency key that comes with door knobs as the bridge. Scroll down for a few pictures from the build!
