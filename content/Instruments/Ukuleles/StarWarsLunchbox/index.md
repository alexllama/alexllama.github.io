I had a great time making this Uke from a Star Wars lunchbox. I shaped the neck entirely by hand so it would taper at the headstock, and added a piezo so it can be played through an amplifier. It’s too bad my fingers are too big to play this comfortably, which is why I can’t play it very well. Actually, I don’t really know how to play Ukulele, so that may also have something to do with it.
