I made this Uke as a gift for my brother in law, who is a chef. I wanted to add a couple of kitchen touches, so the bridge is made from a spatula handle, the strings are held in place by a leaf from a vegetable steamer, and the sound hole has a cheese grater as its cover. The neck was made from butcher block scrap wood.
