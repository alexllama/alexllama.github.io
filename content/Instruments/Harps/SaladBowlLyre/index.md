I got this idea from YouTube after being mesmerized by Tobias Kaye’s Sounding Bowl videos on YouTube. I just had to make one. It’s a simple project, just needed to find the right bowl. This particular bowl comes from Granville VT via my local Goodwill. I bought a set of 16 Lyre strings from Amazon but only used 12 of them, tuned as follows: E5 D5 C5 B4 A4 G4 F4 E4 D4 C4 B3 A3. The final product sounds fine but a bit thin in my opinion, but you tell me…
