This one is more of a shelf piece than an actual instrument to play. I got the coconut and wood scraps while walking on the beach in Melbourne, FL and packed them in my suitcase so I could make an instrument out of them. The coconut cracked as I was putting it together from the tension, so they have just enough tension to look good.
