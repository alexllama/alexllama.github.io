I got this box in a small cigar shop in the Miami airport. It is made entirely of wood, and is pretty solid. The bridge is made from flooring, and is made from a very hard wood whose name I forget. I got some Lyre strings and zither pins to make this instrument. I added a piezo under the bridge, so you can play it through an amp. The inserts that came with the box were in the turquoise color, so I used it to make a jack plate.
