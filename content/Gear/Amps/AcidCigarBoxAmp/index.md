Just about everyone that makes amps uses an Acid cigar box at some point, and here’s my attempt at it. These boxes are pretty sturdy and roomy, so they are perfect for making an amp. The speaker and grill came from a big speaker I found on the side of the road…the kind that was about 3 feet tall and would be part of the furniture in people’s homes in the 80’s. This was the grill for the mid-range. I used an amp kit I bought online. It’s not very loud, but I got to solder, so it was fun to put together. Great starter project.
