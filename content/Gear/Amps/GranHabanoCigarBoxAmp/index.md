This box is a beauty. I saw it at a cigar store in Key West and immediately knew I would make an amp out of it. The amp itself is made from a toy guitar and amp combo. The guitar was pretty much garbage, but the amp was definitely worth salvaging. Even the volume knob was red, which matched perfectly with the box. I ended up adding a second speaker to give it a bit more oomph.
