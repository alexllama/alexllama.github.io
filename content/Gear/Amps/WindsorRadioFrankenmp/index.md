I like this radio because it had the ability to tune into TV channels. However, I much prefer making amps out of cassette players. So I combined both…I got the circuitry from a cassette player and stuffed it inside this radio’s case. I connected the tuning knob to the circuit to get some interesting glitched out effects. The resulting amp sounds great, and looks great too!

On the top left is the cassette player that sacrificed itself so that this amp could live. Eagle eyed viewers will see on the bottom left the fume extractor fan I made from an Altoids tin and an old PC fan. On the right is the Popcorn tin chugger I made, featured elsewhere on this website." >}}
