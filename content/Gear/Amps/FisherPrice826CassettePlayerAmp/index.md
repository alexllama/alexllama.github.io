This is the one that started my obsession with making amps out of cassette players. It’s very easy to do. All you need is to wire up a 1/4″ jack to the positive end of the cassette head and to ground. That’s it! You can hunt around on the circuit board until you find the right point to solder, which is what I did here.

Plus, they tend to overdrive, so the sound that comes out of it is distorted, great for playing blues or rock. You have to press Play for it to work, which gets a chuckle every time. I ended up selling this one, and have regretted it every since. Going to have to get another one.
