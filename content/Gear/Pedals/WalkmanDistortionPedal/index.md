Since you can make small amps out of cassette players, and they tend to give you a bit of overdrive, I figured you could make a pedal out of a walkman. Turns out that was a good assumption. Wiring a 3/4″ jack to the cassette head is all it takes, then take the headphone out and connect that to an amp and you are done. In this case the volume knob controls how much distortion you get out of the “pedal.” It’s a bit clunky because you also have to mess around with the volume on the amp to get a good sound, but I like the effect that this walkman makes.
