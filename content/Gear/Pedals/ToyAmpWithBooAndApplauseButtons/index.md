This one is a bit of a joke. I found this toy guitar/amp combo at Goodwill and of course had to get it to use for various projects. The amp showed some potential as a pedal, so I quickly took it apart to see what I could do with it. It features a button that plays a crowd applauding and cheering, and a second button that boos. A third button cycles through a few different, yet very repetitive beats for you to play along. And it has two separate line in connectors for a microphone and MP3 or other music source. It even has a light that changes color continuously and is quite bright. This lets you recreate the full experience of being in concert right at home!

In order to make it stand out, I removed the innards out of the ugly plastic housing and jammed them into a one of a kind tequila box that my son and I hydro dipped using spray paint. To make it a proper pedal, I took out the speaker and replaced it with a 1/4″ jack. The buttons are just glued on the outside of the box, but I think that just gives it character. The power switch is one I had in my parts box, which makes a nice click sound when you turn it on and off.
