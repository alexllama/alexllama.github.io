People will throw out all kinds of things because they don’t work anymore. For example, someone threw out a 10″ subwoofer, even though the speaker itself was intact. I had a pair of bookshelf speakers that were languishing in the basement, so I liberated them out of their enclosures, and built this box to hold them all. The box is mostly MDF, and the sides are plywood, because I ran out of MDF…all scraps from other projects. I got a bluetooth amp from Amazon which pumps out 50W per channel, plus 50W for the subwoofer. You can even tune the subwoofer frequency to reduce vibrations. I really like how this one came out and use it daily in my home office. I don’t think I have raised the volume more than 1/4 of the way given how loud it can get.
