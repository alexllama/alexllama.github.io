It’s amazing how small some of these bluetooth amps are that you can get online. Cheap too. I got this one for $15 and it is smaller than the remote that comes with it. I had an old flat screen TV that finally bit the dust, so I harvested the speakers to make this beauty. Truth be told it is not the best sounding sound system, but what do you want for $15…
