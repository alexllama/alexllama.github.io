I had this old Cambridge Sound Works surround sound PC speaker system sitting in my closet for about 25 years, untouched. It includes four speakers, a subwoofer and a volume knob that all plug into an amplifier. It always sounded really well, but I had no use for it, and just hated to throw it out. Instead of tossing it into the landfill, I made a Bluetooth speaker that I now take with us when we go camping. The box is made from spare MDF I had lying around. I bought a Bluetooth transmitter/receiver that you would use in your car with an aux cable, and wired the output of that into the speakers. I always liked sound reactive LEDs, so I added an LED soundbar. And since I planned to use this outside for long periods of time, I added a wireless charger on top to me able to charge my phone while listening to music all day long. The best part is that everything is using off the shelf components connected into a power strip in the box. No soldering at all was required.
