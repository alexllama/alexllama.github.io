This is more of a test to see if I could make a guitar pickup. I took a motor out of a fan to make a [microphone](/instruments/mics/phonespeakerinfancase), and kept the coil. I then took a piece of copper wire and wrapped it around the coil, and added a couple of neodymium magnets. Then I hooked up a 1/4″ jack and tested it out. It worked! The sound was very low though, so not likely to use this in an instrument…but it worked!
