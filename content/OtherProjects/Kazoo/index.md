The question is not “why make a kazoo?” It is “Why NOT make a kazoo?” I made this from a paint stirrer I got at Home Depot and wax paper. It’s three layers: a top, a bottom, and sides, so that it is hollow in the middle. I actually messed up and made the tapered part in the wrong end. Your mouth goes near the port with wax paper, not the other side. Oh well, it works as good as you could expect a kazoo to work. Fun fact, you don’t blow into a kazoo, you hum into it to make the sound.
