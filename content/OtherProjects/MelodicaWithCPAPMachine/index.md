My father had this pianica (you may know it as a melodica) that he would play for us when we were kids in the 1970’s. When he passed away in 2020 I inherited it, and it is a treasured keepsake. I wanted to be able to play it, and kept thinking of ways to blow air into it without having to do it myself. I use a CPAP machine, and had a spare one, so one day it hit me…this would be the perfect machine to blow air into it…you can regulate the amount of air that it blows, and is whisper-quiet. Initially I just had the CPAP sitting next to the pianica, but eventually I built a box in which to keep the CPAP.
