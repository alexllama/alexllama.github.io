There's plenty of people making these on the internet, and I finally got around to making one. Using a piece of 3/4" Schedule 40 PVC pipe that I had in my garage, I made this Native American style flute. It is tuned as follows: G4 A#4 C5 D5 D#5 F5 G5. I haven't decided if I'm going to paint and decorate it, or leave it as is so you can tell it's a piece of PVC. My laziness and interest in moving on to the next project tells me to leave it as is...
