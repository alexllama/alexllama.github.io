I watched a video by Musique De Nulle Part where he made one of these and just had to make my own. I had a scrap piece of wood that came from an old cabinet, sanded it down, and cut out notches for the tuners. I attached cans to the board with L brackets, strung it up with some old guitar strings, and that was it! I think different strings would have sounded better, but thatâ€™s all I had at the time.
