If you have ever seen the Blue Man Group you’ve seen them [play this instrument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiaxRa7DN1M), which consists of PVC tubes of different lengths, which they strike with flat rubber mallets. According to Wikipedia this instrument originates in Papua New Guinea and is called a Thongophone…you learn something new every day!

I wanted the kids to be involved in making this instrument, so they helped as much as possible, mostly in the paint department. Being kids, they of course could not agree on a color, so we painted the frame half pink, and half blue. It was a lot of fun to make, and sounded ok when done. Using tubes of wider diameter would create a deeper and louder sound, which I’ll keep in mind if we ever make another one of these.
