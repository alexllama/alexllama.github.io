One day we went to visit my friend’s house, and a couple of houses down from his we spotted this piano that had been thrown out. It was in pieces, like it had been dropped from the sky. I asked my friend to come with me and we salvaged as much as we could, knowing that I would be using the parts for projects for some time. I made a piece of art from the keys, saved all the hammers, and all the eye hooks, which I have used as string trees and in my kalimbas for years. I finally ran out of them in 2022. I cut the fall board into a few pieces, made a [kalimba](/instruments/kalimbas/pianofallboard) our of one piece and hung the piece with the company logo as its own art piece. The coolest part is that while taking it apart, I saw pieces that were hand signed, and had dates in the late 1800’s.
