This one came from an idea my daughter had. I was building a [noise box](/otherprojects/noisebox) which has a hard drive platter attached to a springy door stop. She thought it would work well to use a hair beret to strike the platter. When we tried it, the sound was pretty good. After she came up with that idea, I thought about making an entire keyboard with hair berets, each of which would strike a pipe from a windchime.
