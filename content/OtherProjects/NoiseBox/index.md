I wanted to make a noise box for my kids to play with. This one has all kinds of junk on it, including a hard drive platter that I mounted on a springy doorstopper, which is hit when you flick a hair beret at it (my daughter’s idea). There’s also a comb, some rubber bands, a few springs and beer caps. To make the thing even more annoying, I added a piezo (contact mic) on the inside so that you can plug it into an amp and really annoy everyone around you!
